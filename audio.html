    <h1>Take What You Want</h1>
    <p>
        Oh, yeah
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
<br>
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
<br>
Why don't you take what you want from me?
<br>
Take what you need from me
<br>
Take what you want and go
<br>
Why don't you take what you want from me?
<br>
Take what you need from me
<br>
Take what you want and go
<br>
I never needed anything from you
<br>
And all I ever asked was for the truth
<br>
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
<br>
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you
<br>
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
<br>
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
<br>
Like a plague, I was wasting away
<br>
Tryna find my way out, find my way out
<br>
And it finally came the day
<br>
I start giving my heart away
<br>
For Heaven's sakes, my bones will break
<br>
But you never own my soul, no
<br>
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
<br>
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
<br>
Why don't you take what you want from me?
<br>
Take what you need from me
<br>
Take what you want and go
<br>
Why don't you take what you want from me?
<br>
Take what you need from me
<br>
Take what you want and go
<br>
I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew (ice)
<br>
I brought up 10 hoes, this coupe only made for two (yes, sir)
<br>
They all ran through it, it ain't nothing left to do
<br>
I need some more reasons to live out this evening (straight up)
<br>
I've been sippin' forever and just taking whatever
<br>
Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
<br>
Let's go our ways, whichever
<br>
You say how is however long
<br>
'Cause you know I'll never be alone
<br>
Love (love, yeah)
<br>
Shorty gon' back
<br>
Need it on sight
<br>
Crack it all back
<br>
Give her that pipe
<br>
All of my gang
<br>
Shawty went bad
<br>
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
<br>
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
<br>
Why don't you take what you want from me
<br>
Take what you need from me
<br>
Take what you want and go
<br>
Why don't you take what you want from me
<br>
Take what you need from me
<br>
Take what you want and go
<br>
Take it all away
<br>
Why don't you (take what you want, take what you need)
<br>
Take what you need from me, yeah
<br>
(Take what you want) why don't you (take what you need?)
<br>
(What you need, yeah)
